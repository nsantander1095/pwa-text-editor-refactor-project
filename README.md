Just Another Text Editor or J.A.T.E. is exactly what the name implies. It is a deployed app that works as a basic text editor. It uses IndexedDB to create an object store and is able to save the typed text to that object store,when the DOM window is unfocused, which also works offline. The application is bundled with Webpack and can be installed as a Progressive Web Application.
